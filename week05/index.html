        <ul>
            <li>This week's reading is great but a bit more challenging than the previous chapters. 
                I have dealt with handling exceptions before but have not heard of "Jest" until
                this week. I can see though the values in doing the test files which is to ensure that 
                the functions are running correctly or have been coded as expected. 
                <br>For this week I followed all the exercises in the chapter reading. I was stuck though 
                for a bit in the numberCruncher.test.js, but at the end I was able to complete all 
                of the exercises and got the final "Passed" outcome as intended. Below are the links
                for the exercise codes.

            <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                <br>Since the last meeting, I read the required chapters and did the exercise codes.
                    I also read the description for team activity and researched in advanced on 
                    different ways to achieve it. When we completed the activity, I then took the 
                    time to complete the second stretch challenge; revised the codes to work with 
                    my template and implemented other modules. 
                <br>This week I also spent several hours working on the project. Lots of factoring, 
                    testing functions, and debugging. I then ensured that it will work with the
                    GitHub template I have chosen from the beginning.
                <br>* Here is the link for our activity this week 
                    [ <a href="team-activity/hike-team.html">Team Activity</a> ].<br>
            </li>
            <li>What am I going to do next?
                <br>I will continue to work on the "ToDo" project and ensure that it is working well.
                    If I finish the project earlier, I will then start the reading and do the exercise 
                    codes for the week 07. 
            </li>
            <li>What are my blockers?
                <br>This week has been good and didn't see any blockers at all.
