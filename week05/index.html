        <ul>
            <li>This week's reading is great but a bit more challenging than the previous chapters. 
                I have dealt with handling exceptions before but have not even heard of "Jest" until
                this week. I can see though the values in doing the test files which is to ensure that 
                the functions are running or have been coded as expected. 
                <br>So this week I tried following the all exercises in the reading. I was stuck though 
                for a bit while in the numberCruncher.test.js, but at the end I was able to complete all 
                of the exercises and got the final "Passed" outcome as intended. Below are the links
                of the codes.
