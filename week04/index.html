        <h3>Reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This week's reading is very interesting and once again I learnt so much from it.
                I liked the chapter about forms as I normally build a lot of different forms at work 
                but using different technology. So in my reading this time, I decided to follow codes
                and build the form instead of highligthing and making notes. Below is the simple form
                as presented in the book including a link to the "Hero" form exercises. 
            </li>
            <li>The materials on Object-Oriented Programming is lengthy but also great as I love this concept 
                of programming. For this chapter, I decided to do both things which is to highlight definitions 
                and also to follow the codes from the book. The exercise codes are located in the main.js file, 
                but its output can be seen in JavaScript console. Listed are some of the things I highligthed
                in this chapter:
                <br>(1) Explanations and definitions of the three main concpets in OOP.
                <br>(2) Different ways in creating or initiating new objects.
                <br>(3) Class declarations and its syntax.
                <br>(4) Prototype, its properties and usage.
                <br>&nbsp;
            </li>

                <h4>Form Exercises:</h4>
