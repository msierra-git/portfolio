        <h3>Report:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                <br>Since the last meeting, I read the required chapters and did the exercise codes
                    to prepare myself for our team meeting. I also read the description for team activity 
                    and researched in advanced on different ways to complete them. Our meeting though did not 
                    go as planned. The lead student was late as he needed to attend another class. So another
                    student jumps in but he overly thinks everything, and as a result we were all over the place 
                    and did not complete all of the core requirements, even after spending two hours in the meeting. 
                    I tried to fix it though after the meeting but my head is hurting already and did not get very far.<br>
            </li>
            <li>What am I going to do next?
                <br>I will read the required chapters and will prepare well for our team meeting. So if ever the 
                    lead student is not there, I can then take the courage to lead to avoid spending so much time in 
                    the meeting. I will also start reading the requirements for the next project.
            </li>
            <li>What are my blockers?
                <br>This week has been a bit busy but is still good and so I didn't see any blockers at all.
            </li>
