        <h3>Reading:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>I feel there were a lot to do this week as I'm trying to brush up or refresh on what 
                I learnt before. On top of these I also created the file structures (week01 to week14) 
                for this course. I also spent considerabe time in deciding on my html templates and 
                played around with different css format and GitHub page themes.
            </li>
            <li>I find the videos are refreshing, and while those concepts are still fresh in my mind 
                as they've just been covered in the last semester course (WDD331 - Advanced CSS), 
                they are still very valuable.
            </li>
        </ul>       
        
        <h3>Report:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>As this is the first week of semester, I did several things in preparation for this course.
                I read the syllabus and the sections on localstorage as required. I also followed the instuctions
                on creating a portfolio. I brushed up on my Javascript skills and learnt how to use GitHub.
            </li>
            <li>What I will be doing next is to continue to review on my Javascript skills as I have not used it 
                since the end of the CS213, which is about 4 semesters ago. I still have access to Codecademy, so 
                I will use that to quickly go through all the lessons on Javascript. 
            </li>
            <li>Two blockers for this week are GitHub and Javascript. With Github, I have been reading from forums 
                and watched YouTube tutorials on how to use it and how to publish the pages. I feel that I learnt 
                the basic thus far, but would need to continuously learn how to use the other features of GitHub 
                to be more effective. With JavaScript, I mentioned above that I would need to quickly go through 
                the Codecademy to refresh my knowledge on the syntax, properties and methods. I will also review
                on my previous notes and projects to help me.                
            </li>
