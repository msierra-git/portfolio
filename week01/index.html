        <h3>Reading:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>I feel there were a lot to do this week as I'm trying to catch up or refresh on what 
                I learnt before. On top of these I also created the file structures (week01 to week14) 
                for this course. I also spent quite some time to decide on my html templates and played 
                around with stylesheet and GitHub page themes.
            </li>
            <li>I find the videos are refreshing, and while those concepts are still fresh in my mind 
                as they've been covered in the last semester course WDD331 - Advaced CSS, they are still 
                very valuable.
            </li>
        </ul>       
        
        <h3>Report:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>As this is the first week of semester, I did several things in preparation for this course.
                I read the syllabus and the sections on localstorage as required. I also followed the instuctions
                on creating a portfolio. 
            </li>
            <li>What I am doing next is to brush up on my Javascript skills as I have not used it since the end
                of the CS213, which is about 4 semesters ago. I still have access to Codecademy that I can use to 
                refresh my skills in Javascript.
            </li>
            <li>Two blockers for this week are GitHub and Javascript. With Github, I read more from forums and watched
                youtube tutorials on how to use it and publish the pages. I feel I learnt the basic thus far but would
                need to continuously learn how to use this to be more effective. With JavaScript, I mentioned above that
                I would need to quickly go through the Codecademy to refresh the syntax and methods to achieve. I will also
                quickly go through my notes and projects in previous semester that can speed up my skills.                
            </li>
