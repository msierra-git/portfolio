            <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                <br>Since there are no readings this week, I spent more time in progressing my project,
                    which is to create a small app to show Star Wars Team coming from API. Clicking on
                    the team names that act like buttons will list their profile images and  names of 
                    person or characters that are affiliated to it. Clicking on the names will then show
                    the details of the person. Here is the link for this week's snapshot of my project. 
                    <a href="project-status/starwars.html">[ Star Wars Team ]</a> app.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>What am I going to do next?
                <br>Next week I'm planning to create the features for the "custom teams", which will allow
                    users to create their own team/s, allocate Star Wars person or characters to that team, 
                    then be able to save those details to local storage. 
            </li>
            <li>What are my blockers?
                <br>I think the project is progressing well and I don't see much blockers this week aside form
                    being a bit busy with my Church responsibilities.
