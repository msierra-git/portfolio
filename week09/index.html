            <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                <br>Since the last meeting, I read the required chapters and followed the example codes then make
                    necessary adjustment to display them on this page. For our team meeting I prepare well in advanced
                    as I'm the assigned lead student for the week. I also tried to come up with a solution for the activity 
                    then presented it during our meeting. This made the meeting smoother as we review the codes which cover
                    required items. We then got enough time to go through and complete a stretch challenge. 
            </li>
            <li>What am I going to do next?
                <br>I will continue to read the required chapters for next week. I will also need to try a few things to
                    see if my proposed project is really feasible, especially with using localStorage only. This way I
                    can still have sufficient time if ever I need to change my project.
            </li>
            <li>What are my blockers?
                <br>This week has been busy due to our upcoming stake conference and all the preparations needed.
                    Because of this I've been doing things as early as I can, but without sacrificing the quality 
                    of my studies. I also have the support of my family who's been lenient in my chores at home.
