            <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                <br>I was able to progress well my project this week. There is even one
                    time that I could not sleep so I spent that entire night coding. I 
                    was able to add the entire "custom team" management feature and also 
                    did several CSS codes to format my page. Here is the link for this 
                    week's snapshot of my project,  
                    <a href="project-status/starwars.html">[ Star Wars Team ]</a> app.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>What am I going to do next?
                <br>Next week I'm planning to do a bit more page formatting and testing
                    the app on different browsers. I will also look for ways to clean up
                    the codes and for more improvement. Overall, I'm planning to complete
                    the project by end of next week. 
            </li>
            <li>What are my blockers?
                <br>I just came back from a three-day Stake YW camp so this prevented me 
                    from giving more time in coding, but since I was able to do so much 
                    before the camp, including an all "nighter", this event did not feel
                    a blocker at all.
