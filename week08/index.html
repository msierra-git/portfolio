        <h3>Report:</h3>
        <ol id="report-section">
            <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                <br>Since the last meeting, I read and re-read the required chapters and spent quite some time in 
                    fixing the example codes as they don't supply the complete files being discussed in the chapters. 
                    Doing these helped me learn new things and re-learn those I learnt from the previous classes. 
                    For our team meeting I prepared by refreshing the things I learnt in using AJAX. I also suggested 
                    ways in approaching the activity to ensure we accomplished the major task and leave the formatting 
                    at the end, for each of us to try and complete.
            </li>
            <li>What am I going to do next?
                <br>I will continue to read the required chapters and will prepare well for our next team meeting 
                    as it's my turn to be the lead student. I will also start looking at different public APIs in 
                    preparation for the next project.                     
            </li>
            <li>What are my blockers?
                <br>I realised that the team activities are getting harder now and required more things than what 
                    the reading is all about. So I think a blocker for us is the lack of experience in doing 
                    things in JavaScript. At times we have to explain how things work to the team thus taking 
                    us a lot longer in completing even just the core requirements. There are also times when we get
                    stuck and we have to search for coding approach and examples in the net to be able to move on.
